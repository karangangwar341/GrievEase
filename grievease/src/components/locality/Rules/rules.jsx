                    <li>Each grievance should be unique and not reported twice by the same person to prevent redundancy.</li>
                    <li>Only the concerned department must be tagged along with the grievances to avoid miscommunication.</li>
                    <li>If you are not aware of the concerned department, lodge it as miscellaneous.</li>
                    <li>Grievances must be specific and actionable, with clear details of the issue and any supporting evidence. Action will be taken on the user if he makes fake complaints.</li>
